//! funny fact :
    //~ you can do anything you want to do 
    //~     (virtual machine)
    //~  this is your world
    //? The learning journey is more important than the result


//! preamble 
    //% You only have to submit a signature.txt file at the root of your repository
    //# You must paste the signature of your machine’s virtual disk on it
    //? The use of snapshots is prohibited

    //! objectives of the project:
/*
    ^ the goal : 
         is a comprehensive guide aimed at empowering individuals 
         who are new to system administration, specifically focusing 
         on mastering the Linux environment
        $ (Learn to set up your first physical server inside a virtual machine)
        # (Learn the basic concepts in system administration and security step by step through practical experience)
        $ The project focuses on setting up a “secure” server (with strong passwords, firewall, and precise permissions)
        # The server is not actually built on real hardware; Rather, 
                # on a virtual machine to experience a secure and isolated server environment

    ^ What does it mean to “create a server” in the world of operating systems
        %  means to set up a computer or virtual machine that provides services or resources
        % to other computers (called clients) over a network
        # (a server is a system that listens for requests
        # (like website visits, file downloads, or data access)
        # and responds to them.)
    
    ^ example:
        ~ A database server stores data and answers queries from applications
        ~ A file server stores and shares files with others
        ~ A web server hosts websites and sends web pages to users’ browsers

    ^  Creating a server involves:
        ? Installing an operating system (like Linux or Windows Server)
        ? Installing server software (like Apache, MySQL, or FTP server)
        ? Configuring network settings so others can connect to it

    ^ note:
        * creating a server = turning a computer into a provider of services rather than just a user of them

    ! importance of the project in learning system administration :
        ^ intro:
            # learn system administration step by step
            # Helps understand the concepts of security, permissions, and server management

        ^ What you gain:
            ~ Learn to set up a “secure” server in a virtual environment
            ~ Gain experience with Linux OS installation and configuration
            ~ Understand how servers provide services to clients over a network
            ~ Learn to manage users, passwords, and firewall rules

        ^ Practical benefits:
            ? Hands-on experience with server setup and administration
            ? Familiarity with real-world server roles (web, database, file servers)
            ? Foundation for advanced topics like networking, security, and automation

        ^ Key takeaway:
            * The project turns theory into practice, allowing you to experiment in a safe, isolated environment
            * Prepares you for real-world system administration tasks and enhances problem-solving skills
